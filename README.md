# Pixels Steering Behavior

We will to explore a application of Steering Behaviors (By, Craig Raynolds, 1982). In resume, we call Vehicles any particules that will be a Steering Behavior. Any Vehicles will be a object that atributes are:

- Position
- Velocity
- Acceleration 

We use OpenCv to read image like a np.array, then we use grayscale to determines the radius of each particules in simulation. There is two differents processes on particules: random walker and restoring force. 

- Random walker: if temperature is increase, this process will be more powerful.
- Repulsion: if temperature is decrease, this process will be more powerful.

# Application:

We use a image for this presentation and we use our code to transform some pixels in a Vehicle. 

> The input will be a image below (The most beatiful girl I ever met):
<img src="assets/alexia.png" alt="The most beatiful girl I ever met" width="200"/>

> On high temperature:
<img src="output/00122_screenshot.png" alt="Input" width="200"/>
<!-- ![Input](output/00001_screenshot.png) -->

> On low temperature:
<img src="output/00222_screenshot.png" alt="Input" width="200"/>
<!-- ![Results](alexia_steer.gif) -->

> In the processes, we will see this:
<img src="project.gif" alt="Results" width="200"/>

# To Run:

First, clone this repository, enter in your directory and run this comand line:

```terminal
> python ising.py assets/alexia.png
```

You will see the simulation above with image I provide. However, if you want simulate with another image, just use path of the your image instead of "assets/alexia.png" and voi a la! Very much simple.
